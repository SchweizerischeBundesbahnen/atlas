## Usage

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>ch.sbb.atlas</groupId>
  <artifactId>user-administration-security</artifactId>
  <version>${revision}</version>
</dependency>
```

`@Import(UserAdministrationConfig.class)` to include the config to the application context.

```java
@PreAuthorize("@userAdministrationService.hasUserPermissionsToCreate(#businessObject, T(ch.sbb.atlas.kafka.model.user.admin.ApplicationType).LIDI)")
public LineVersion create(LineVersion businessObject) {
    return save(businessObject);
}
```

This snippet will call the Bean with name `userAdministrationService` and execute the `hasUserPermissionsToCreate` function. 
The parameter `businessObject` is passed along with the enum constant for the application type.
If the function returns true, the user is allowed to proceed, if it returns false, spring will return an access denied (403 - Forbidden).
