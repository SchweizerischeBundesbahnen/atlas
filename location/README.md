## ADR Architecture Decision Record

The aim of this service is to assign the SLOIDs centrally and thus ensure that they are unique across all services.
Currently, this service is used by the prm-directory and service-point-directory to obtain/verify their SLOIDs.
See [ADR-0021: SLOID Service](https://confluence.sbb.ch/x/LCRTmw).
