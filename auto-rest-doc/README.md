## Purpose

The purpose of this library is to automatically generate the relevant snippets for rest documentation.

The additionally created snippets are combined in the `atlas-doc.adoc` file and may be included in the rest doc like this:

```asciidoc
include::{snippets}/line-controller-api-test/should-get-line-overview/atlas-doc.adoc[]
```
