## Service Point Directory in ATLAS

The main goal is to serve the following business objects:

- Service Points (Dienststellen)
- Traffic Point Elements (Verkehrspunktelemente)
- Loading Points (Ladestellen)

Each of these business objects has its own versioning.

`TrafficPointElements` and `LoadingPoints` always belong to a `ServicePoint`, referencing it
via `servicePointNumber`.

These objects are stored and represented in our [Database Schema](src/docs/db-schema.md)
Additional business documentation may be found on
Confluence: https://confluence.sbb.ch/display/ATLAS/%5BDiDok%5D+Dienststellenverwaltung

## Service Point geographic data in ATLAS

The main goal is to serve geographic information about service points and visualize on a map,
without
using any 3rd-party services or SDKs.

### How?

All coordinates and attributes of service points, are mapped
as [mapbox vector tiles](https://docs.mapbox.com/data/tilesets/guides/vector-tiles-standards/).

Then the resulting vector tile object is serialized
to [Google Protobufs (PBF)](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf),
and send in response back to a web client.

Protobuf is open source and it performs better than
json+gzip: https://auth0.com/blog/beating-json-performance-with-protobuf/

There are several open source web client libraries, to read and display protobuf vector tiles on
a map in Web:

- [Mapbox GL JS](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) - JavaScript/WebGL vector maps library.
- [MapLibre GL](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) - Is a community led fork derived from
  Mapbox GL JS prior to their switch to a non-OSS license.
- [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/mapbox-vector-layer.html) - JavaScript
  vector & raster library.
- [Vector Tiles Google Maps](https://github.com/techjb/Vector-Tiles-Google-Maps) - Render vector
  tile layers on Google Maps.

_(Find an extended list on https://github.com/mapbox/awesome-vector-tiles)._

We are using [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/), which is the best Open Source alternative of the
Mapbox GL Client.

The JAVA Backend vector tiles encoder service, was found
on [GitHub](https://github.com/ElectronicChartCentre/java-vector-tile) and simplified to handle
Point-Geometries-Only.

#### Important DEV-notice

Always provide all input coordinates for vector tiles in Wgs84WebMercator spatial
reference (https://epsg.io/3857), which is the coordinate system, used for rendering maps in Google
Maps, OpenStreetMap, etc.

## Full clean import of service points, traffic point elements and loading points

To do a full import of service points, traffic point elements and loading points from csv we need to delete all the existing data
from the service-point db:

```sql
-- Service Points
delete
from service_point_version_means_of_transport;

delete
from service_point_version_categories;

delete
from service_point_version;

-- faster delete without fk constraint
alter table service_point_version drop constraint fk_service_point_geolocation_id;

delete
from service_point_version_geolocation;

alter table service_point_version
    add constraint fk_service_point_geolocation_id
        FOREIGN KEY (service_point_geolocation_id)
            REFERENCES service_point_version_geolocation (id);

delete
from service_point_fot_comment;

-- Traffic Point Elements
delete
from traffic_point_element_version;

-- faster delete without fk constraint
alter table traffic_point_element_version drop constraint fk_traffic_point_element_version_geolocation_id;

delete
from traffic_point_element_version_geolocation;

alter table traffic_point_element_version
    add constraint fk_traffic_point_element_version_geolocation_id
        FOREIGN KEY (traffic_point_geolocation_id)
            REFERENCES traffic_point_element_version_geolocation (id);

-- Loading Points
delete
from loading_point_version;
```

Further we need to clear the import-service-point db: see * [Reset Batch](../documentation/batch_util.md).

And the Location DB:

For Traffic Point Elements:

```sql
delete
from allocated_sloid
where sloidtype = 'AREA'
   or sloidtype = 'PLATFORM';
```

For Service Points:

```sql
delete
from allocated_sloid
where sloidtype = 'SERVICE_POINT';

truncate table available_service_point_sloid;

insert into available_service_point_sloid
select ('ch:1:sloid:' || available_sloids) as sloid, 'SWITZERLAND' as country
from generate_series(1, 99999) as available_sloids;

insert into available_service_point_sloid
select ('ch:1:sloid:' || available_sloids + 1100000) as sloid, 'GERMANY_BUS' as country
from generate_series(1, 99999) as available_sloids;

insert into available_service_point_sloid
select ('ch:1:sloid:' || available_sloids + 1200000) as sloid, 'AUSTRIA_BUS' as country
from generate_series(1, 99999) as available_sloids;

insert into available_service_point_sloid
select ('ch:1:sloid:' || available_sloids + 1300000) as sloid, 'ITALY_BUS' as country
from generate_series(1, 99999) as available_sloids;

insert into available_service_point_sloid
select ('ch:1:sloid:' || available_sloids + 1400000) as sloid, 'FRANCE_BUS' as country
from generate_series(1, 99999) as available_sloids;
```
