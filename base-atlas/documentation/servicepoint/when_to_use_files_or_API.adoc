== Service Point data Consuming Rules

=== When to use CSV or JSON
ATLAS generates CSV and JSON files so that all service points can be made available to users on a daily basis:

* CSV files are **Human Readable** and are mainly used by **Business People**.
* JSON files are "Client/Machine Readable" and are consumed by users to import all service points into their service

=== When to use the Service Point API
The API provided by atlas offers the customer the opportunity to obtain data in real time. It is ideal for client-specific
projections (defined by invocation params), since filtering and sorting can be implemented arbitrarily.
Customers get exactly the data they want.

*ATTENTION: Our API is not suitable for bulk exports. Customers should therefore use the files to obtain large amounts of data.*


=== How to decide between ServicePoint API or File (JSON/CSV)
If you need every day all data, like all actual ServicePoints or all future timetable ServicePoints,
choose CSV or JSON file available on the Export Service Point Service, otherwise, use the Service Point API.
